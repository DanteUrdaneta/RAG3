Okay, so today I'm going to show you how
to tie a tie. A couple quick hints for you,
when you're picking out a tie you want to
pick out a tie that has some sort of color
that that picks up something in your shirt,
it's just an added classy little touch. Okay,
so we go ahead and flip up our collar, take the
tie put the fat side down. This is an important
part because you want at the end you want the
tie to come out right about your waist line,
looks cool that way. If you have it up here,
that's dorky. If you're knot is big and you
got a short tie, dorky. You don't want to do
that, alright? Just telling you. Okay, so we go
ahead and get started here, and we take the fat
one, fat side right and we go around the front,
come around the back, we go down down through the
hole right there. You'll want to pay attention to
that knot there while you're doing this you want
to pay attention to that knot because you're kind
of building the knot as you go along, right? Okay
so we're good here. Then we come across the front,
we go around the back and come through. And
now you still want to pay attention to that
knot and then now you're coming through there
Okay see how we got that nice knot now? And
then there you go. We've got a beautiful knot.
Now we take this and we drop this collar down.
Make sure you don't have anything sticking out
the back, that's also dorky. Okay and then you
go ahead and cinch it up and I don't even think
you need to button this I don't normally. I need
to leave it a little bit loose so I can actually
breathe. I bring it on up and a nice clean knot
came out to right about my waist. Perfect! Looks
good. Then I use a button-down collar because
that always makes it nice and clean at the end
too. It makes it easy. Alright! There you go.
